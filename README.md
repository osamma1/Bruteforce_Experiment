Brute-forces the password using letters, digits, or even symbols.
Shows the number of attempts and time taken to crack it — all in a clean, interactive GUI.
Includes toggle options for showing guesses and including symbols.
🎯 Purpose:
This project was created purely for educational purposes, to:
Understand the underlying logic of brute-force attacks.
Visualize the impact of password strength.
Learn how GUI apps can be built using Tkinter.
